# Lost Mines of Phandalin

## Maps

I mostly use the maps by [Mike Schley][maplink] where appropriate, purchase the player versions of the images to get the same experience.

Maps are normally within a 'maps/' subdirectory and the map html file will be in the root directory of an "encounter".
The html files just resizes the map to the projector size I was using.

For example, for the overworld map you will have to add `maps/overworld.jpeg` to this directory.

## Sound Effects

Where possible, there will be sounds for an encounter in a 'sfx/' subdirectory. 
I found the best way to mix the sounds when DM'ing was to have two [VLC][vlc] players open with the play list and use the different volumes for mixing.

## Projector

To project the maps I have used a Dell M110 mounted about 1.5m above our table area.
