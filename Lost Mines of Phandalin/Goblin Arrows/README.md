# Goblin Arrows

## Maps

To get this working with the maps by [Mike Schley][maplink], purchase the player version of Cragmaw Castle and copy into `maps/cragmaw_hideout/base.jpeg`.
You will have to resize the map to 1722x1200 for the best effect.

The cart encounter has a map that was created using [Dungeon Painter Online][dpo]. The source file for the map is in the maps directory

The cave encounter has a _fog of war_ effect which is controlled with the number keys. The map has a slightly different mapping compared to the DM version as I was going off memory. Zones 5 and 7 were combined and zone 6 was split into two zones.

Numbers to zone mappings. Hit a number and the zone will toggle.
1. Outside clearing (defaults to shown)
2. Blind
3. Wolf Kennel
4. Side tunnel and bridge
5. Lower barracks cave
6. Upper barracks cave (where Sildar is held)
7. Twin pools cave and upper corridor
8. Klaargs room

## Sound Effects

In the sfx folder is a number of sound effects I used for the encounter which I got from [SoundDogs][sfx]. The cart sound was modified with [Audacity][audacity] in order to get a better loop.
I found the best way to mix the sounds when DM'ing was to have two [VLC][vlc] players open with the play list and use the different volumes for mixing.
